Hello! I'm yees7. I like to program, and am interested in topics such as game development and data science, and making things that people can use. I mainly code in Python, but I am learning C++, and hope one day I will be a master at Rust. I am a major programming fan and a self-teacher. My favourite code editor is VSCode.
